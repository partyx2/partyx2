<p>kelsey ⚢ they/them 17 <a href="https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Gendervoid" target="blank">nonbinary</a> lesbian (eng/filo OK)</p>
<p>my interests include art, ocs, roblox, minecraft, ena: dbbq, mizisua, kasane teto and others. for specifics, i like gasa4/sc, die of death, and dive !!! roblox-wise and i like mcsm, unstable universe, whitepine, pvp + parkour civilization & keep up with: kenadian, wato1876, parrotx2, wifies, rekrap (occasionally) etc minecraft-wise. i am not too dedicated to other smps that's not uu so keep your hopes low... i main parrotx2 and kenadian. :3c i'm a huge fan of lore-related shenanigans.</p>
<p>please don't interact with me if your main interest is forsaken, you call robots in general “clankers”, treat female characters especially poor and weird, hate my main interests, fit the general dni criteria, or you're under thirteen. otherwise, do whatever but don't be a weirdo. interact with caution always. c+h + whispers are also okay and encouraged since im offtab ninety percent of the time. you can find me sitting around the roblox / mc area.</p>
<p>if you ever plan on talking to me, just know that i'm adhdtistic so it will most likely affect how we interact if you choose not to be careful. i am very friendly actually, i just find typing like this easier. sorry if i come off as stand-offish at all. for any fun "this character is like me" stuff, i am quite literally c!kenadian, loveshot and mizi irl. i hope i won't disappoint you!</p>
