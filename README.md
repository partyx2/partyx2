<p align="center"> i don't want to make a separate rentry for ponytown because i don't go here as often anymore. . . my interests include art, ocs, roblox, minecraft, ena: dbbq and others. for specifics, i like gasa4/sc, die of death, and dive !!! roblox-wise and i like mcsm, mcyters like parrotx2, wifies, and wato1876 plus keep up with unstable universe, and whitepine minecraft-wise.</p>
<p align="center"> please don't interact with me if your main interest is forsaken, you call robots in general “clankers”, treat female characters especially poor and weird, hate my main interests, fit the general dni criteria, or you're under thirteen. otherwise, do whatever but don't be a weirdo. interact with caution always. c+h + whispers are also okay and encouraged since im offtab ninety percent of the time. you can find me sitting around the roblox / mc area.
