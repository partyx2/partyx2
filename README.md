<p>my interests include art, ocs, roblox, minecraft, ena: dbbq, mizisua, kasane teto and others. for specifics, i like gasa4/sc, die of death, and dive !!! roblox-wise and i like mcsm, mcyters like parrotx2, wifies, and wato1876 plus keep up with unstable universe, and whitepine minecraft-wise. my mcyters aren't fixed on those three but they're the ones i watch the most.</p>
<p>please don't interact with me if your main interest is forsaken, you call robots in general “clankers”, treat female characters especially poor and weird, hate my main interests, fit the general dni criteria, or you're under thirteen. otherwise, do whatever but don't be a weirdo. interact with caution always. c+h + whispers are also okay and encouraged since im offtab ninety percent of the time. you can find me sitting around the roblox / mc area.</p>
<p>if you ever plan on talking to me, just know that i'm adhdtistic so it will most likely affect how we interact if you choose not to be careful. i am very friendly actually, i just find typing like this easier. sorry if i come off as stand-offish at all. and for my personality check... just know that c!parrotx2, sales ena, mizi and loveshot are so insanely mecore. i hope i won't disappoint you!</p>
